  // let's breakdown what this below line actually means :-
  // the author field in the Post model represents the relation between the User table/model and the Post model
  // author User means it is related with User model
  // @relation means the relation between them
  // references means the foreign key, which is used to link the Post model with the User model
  // fields is the attribute which stores the foreign key, here the authorId tells who is the owner of the post

  author User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
